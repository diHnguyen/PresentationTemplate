# Presentation Template (Clemson Purple)

Please feel free to use this template for your research presentation. A few things you can find here:
- List with bullets and numbered list
- How to draw a network using tikzfigure + choose color of arcs on the network + add arc labels
- Plot a graph
- Create a figure that contains multiple subfigures
- Split a slide into multiple columns
- Create a table + change column spacing

If you have any recommendations or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Additional information will be added in the near future.

My preferred way to create a table: https://www.latex-tables.com/
(Note: You may need to make some minor edits after generating the latex code for your table using the website linked above.)
