# OR Presentation Template (Clemson Purple)

I study network problems (Operations Research). This template contains a some items that I have repeatedly used when creating presentation slides. Please feel free to use this template. A few things you can find here:
- List with bullets and numbered list
- Frame/Block for theorems and propositions
- How to draw a network using tikzfigure + choose color of arcs on the network + add arc labels
- Plot a graph
- Create a figure that contains multiple subfigures
- Split a slide into multiple columns
- Create a table + change column spacing
- Scaling figures and tables 

Additional information will be added in the near future. If you have any recommendations or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

My preferred way to create Latex code from an Excel table: https://www.latex-tables.com/
(Note: You may need to make some minor edits after generating the latex code for your table using the website linked above.)
