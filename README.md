# Presentation Template (Clemson Purple)

Please feel free to use this template for your research presentation. 

If you have any recommendations or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

Some notes:
- There are only 2 files: one tex file and one image file.
- The tex file contains a basic presentation template, with a few examples of network flow figures.
- More information will be added in the near future.

(Note: You may need to make some minor edits after generating the latex code for your table using the website linked above.)
